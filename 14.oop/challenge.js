///////////////////////////////// CODING CHALLENGE 3
*/
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child
// "class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the
// current battery charge in % ('charge' property)
// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument
// 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'
// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20,
// and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140
// km/h, with a charge of 22%'
// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate',
// 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when
// you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰
