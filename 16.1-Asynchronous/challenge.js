"use strict";

// 1. Create a function 'whereAmI' which takes as inputs a latitude value ('lat')
// and a longitude value ('lng') (these are GPS coordinates, examples are in test
// data below).

// whereAmI(52.508, 13.381);

// btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
//   whereAmI(52.508, 13.381);
// });

// 2. Do ‚Äúreverse geocoding‚Äù of the provided coordinates. Reverse geocoding means
// to convert coordinates to a meaningful location, like a city and country name.
// Use this API to do reverse geocoding: https://geocode.xyz/api. The AJAX call
// will be done to a URL with this format:
// https://geocode.xyz/52.508,13.381?geoit=json. Use the fetch API and
// promises to get the data. Do not use the 'getJSON' function we created, that
// is cheating üòâ

// 3. Once you have the data, take a look at it in the console to see all the attributes
// that you received about the provided location. Then, using this data, log a
// message like this to the console: ‚ÄúYou are in Berlin, Germany‚Äù

// 4. Chain a .catch method to the end of the promise chain and log errors to the
// console

// 5. This API allows you to make only 3 requests per second. If you reload fast, you
// will get this error with code 403. This is an error with the request. Remember,
// fetch() does not reject the promise in this case. So create an error to reject
// the promise yourself, with a meaningful error message

// 6. Now it's time to use the received data to render a country. So take the relevant
// attribute from the geocoding API result, and plug it into the countries API that
// we have been using.

// 7. Render the country and catch any errors, just like we have done in the last
// lecture (you can even copy this code, no need to type the same code)

/////////////////////////////////// CODING CHALLENGE 2 ///////////////////////////////////

// PART 1
// 1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives 'imgPath' as an input.
// This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use
// document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the
// provided image path

// 2. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the
// 'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the
// image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image (listen for
// the'error' event), reject the promise

// 3. If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution
// PART 2

// 4. Consume the promise using .then and also add an error handler

// 5. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the 'wait'
// function we created earlier

// 6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display CSS
// property to 'none'), and load a second image (Hint: Use the image element
// returned by the 'createImage' promise to hide the current image. You will
// need a global variable for that üòâ)

// 7. After the second image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds again

// 8. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image
